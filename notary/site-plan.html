      <h3>Main Objective</h3>
      <p>
Fiekai Notary Services provides services to certify and authenticate signatures for many types of loans and documents. Once a lender or financial institution requires documents to be notarized,  the lender will  require a certified notarized signature in order for the documents to be legally accepted. This site aims to deliver top notch assistance for the understanding and clarity as to why things need to be notarized and the purpose the notary agent serves. This site will be a way for customers to book a notary signing, set an appointment and use online technology to complete signings within the comfort of their own home.  
</p>
   <h3> Clarity and Understanding</h3>
<p>The information on the site will clarify what is needed by the customer, what the agent will provide and what the agent is allowed to explain. Certain federal regulations prevent the discussion for the agent to explain many topics in a notary setting. So this site will help alleviate any questions that customers may have before their appointment with the notary agent.  Customers will be able to request notary services by navigating the site and choosing the type of service that best suits their needs. On the home page, customers will be introduced to the owner and operator of Fiekai Notary Services, along with visuals that will enhance their experience and provide comfort.
